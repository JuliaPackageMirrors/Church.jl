Memoize:
  Based on MCMC chain state (indicated by rand(Int64)).

Generalize:
  Allow sampling from random functions (constructed via eval/currying?)

Samplers:
  Add facility for different proposal distribution.
  sample(dist; proposal= ...)

Optimization:
  Collapse deterministic functions

Extend libraries:
  Memoized/infinite vector datastructure?
  Vectors:
    IID(dist, dims)
    Joint(dist1, dist2...)
    Joint(dists)

Error checking:
  Det error checking - det.f cannot return SDB.

README
Construct a sample, assigned to a variable, a.
a = sample(d::Distribution)
