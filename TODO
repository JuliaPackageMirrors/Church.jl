Convergence diagnostics
  trace plot
  autocorrelation
  histogram
  implementation
    requires a facility for recording samples
    macro?

Samplers
  slice
  multiple variable proposals
  gradient

Det with a sampled function returns another function?

Allow Vector{Sample} to be passed into deterministic function

Optimization:
  Collapse deterministic functions?
  Dynamic dependency graph?
    Every node has:
      static_deps
      dynamic_deps

Extend libraries:
  Vectors:
    IID(dist, dims)
    Joint(dist1, dist2...)
    Joint(dists)
