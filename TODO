Interface
  Samples from user defined distributions are created by calling a function (e.g. geom()).
  Samples from base distributions must therefore be created by calling a function.
  GetIndex as before.
  Would like to be able to have max(normal(), normal()).
    However, it is difficult/impossible to overload functions in this way.
    Instead, call max[a, b] - why does it make sense for this to be []?
    Could return equal object ids max[a, b] === max[a, b].
  

Optimization:
Dynamic dependency graph?
  Every node has:
    static_deps
    dynamic_deps

Samplers:
  Add facility for different proposal distribution.
  sample(dist; proposal= ...)

Optimization:
  Collapse deterministic functions?

Extend libraries:
  Memoized/infinite vector datastructure?
  Vectors:
    IID(dist, dims)
    Joint(dist1, dist2...)
    Joint(dists)

Error checking:
  Det error checking - det.f cannot return SDB.

README
Construct a sample, assigned to a variable, a.
a = sample(d::Distribution)
