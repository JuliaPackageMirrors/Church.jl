Convergence diagnostics
  Use MCMC.jl.
  Add trace plot, and histogram to MCMC.jl?
  implementation
    check resample for drawing samples?

Samplers
  Use MCMC.jl.
  Interface for to add new samplers.
  Automatic differentiation of univariate functions by vectors?

Det with a sampled function returns another function?

Optimization:
  Collapse deterministic functions?
  Dynamic dependency graph?
    Every node has:
      static_deps
      dynamic_deps

Extend libraries:
  Vectors:
    IID(dist, dims)
    Joint(dist1, dist2...)
    Joint(dists)
