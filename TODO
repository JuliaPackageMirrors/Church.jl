Use fallbacks for datastructures
  strengthen
  weaken
  isweak
Allow dists which cannot be sampled directly (but can compute normalisation constant).
  initial fallback for rand.
  Must define a sampler.
  Must define NORMALISED logpdf/logpmf.
Allow weighting of nodes, so they get sampled more frequently
Probabilistic profiling.
log-joint - sum logp across all samples, and backwards from conditioned variables.

Optimization:
  Collapse deterministic functions?
  Dynamic dependency graph?
    Every node has:
      static_deps
      dynamic_deps

Extend libraries:
  Vectors:
    IID(dist, dims)
    Joint(dist1, dist2...)
    Joint(dists)
